      "From a very early age, it was clear Colin Parks was destined to be a graphic designer. His earliest commission was a series of drawings for his elementary school’s Christmas production programs, followed shortly by a logo project in middle school, posters for high school productions, and a welcome sign for his hometown; all this before any real training. Since then, Colin has spent half his life as apractising professional with experience as an in-house designer for studios and agencies, in publishing (he can legitimately state he’s designed covers and interiors of approximately one thousand books), and as a freelancer. For him, design is best when clean and clear execution is based on a strong concept, and he has a penchant for mid-20th century aesthetics—a time when authentic ideas reigned over templated Photoshop effects.",
